	/* Idea was if clicked on a link set that as the new active.
	 * However, I didn't have time to think this through thoroughly.
	 * Check if any container is active and this container is not active,
	 * then set new active to via onclick. Have a feeling this would have
	 * needed an onload too.

	 * After Thoughts *
	 * Actually, just thought, could read href attribute and if equal to URL
	 * then set to active if trueee, even PHP could achieve this
